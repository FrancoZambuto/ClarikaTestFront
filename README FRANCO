I want to clarify that I spent most part of my time in the backend and couldn't do it better on front end side, where I'm better than backed. If I could have more time, I definitively add more validations to the form creating a custom validation class, also I will add some label where I can display the errors using form control directives. On TS File I would prefer to use a data stream pattern with observables and behavior subjects
